### <a id="makeHTTPDriver"></a> `makeHTTPDriver(options)`

HTTP Driver factory.

This is a function which, when called, returns a HTTP Driver for Cycle.js
apps. The driver is also a function, and it takes an Observable of requests
as input, and generates a metastream of responses.

**Requests**. The Observable of requests should emit either strings or
objects. If the Observable emits strings, those should be the URL of the
remote resource over HTTP. If the Observable emits objects, these should be
instructions how superagent should execute the request. These objects
follow a structure similar to superagent's request API itself.
`request` object properties:

- `url` *(String)*: the remote resource path. **required**
- `method` *(String)*: HTTP Method for the request (GET, POST, PUT, etc).
- `query` *(Object)*: an object with the payload for `GET` or `POST`.
- `send` *(Object)*: an object with the payload for `POST`.
- `headers` *(Object)*: object specifying HTTP headers.
- `accept` *(String)*: the Accept header.
- `type` *(String)*: a short-hand for setting Content-Type.
- `user` *(String)*: username for authentication.
- `password` *(String)*: password for authentication.
- `field` *(Object)*: object where key/values are Form fields.
- `attach` *(Array)*: array of objects, where each object specifies `name`,
`path`, and `filename` of a resource to upload.
- `withCredentials` *(Boolean)*: enables the ability to send cookies from
the origin.
- `redirects` *(Number)*: number of redirects to follow.
- `eager` *(Boolean)*: whether or not to execute the request regardless of
  usage of its corresponding response. Default value is `false` (i.e.,
  the request is lazy). Main use case is: set this option to `true` if you
  send POST requests and you are not interested in its response.

**Responses**. A metastream is an Observable of Observables. The response
metastream emits Observables of responses. These Observables of responses
have a `request` field attached to them (to the Observable object itself)
indicating which request (from the driver input) generated this response
Observable. The response Observables themselves emit the response object
received through superagent.

#### Arguments:

- `options :: Object` an object with settings options that apply globally for all requests processed by the returned HTTP Driver function. The
options are:
- `eager` *(Boolean)*: execute the HTTP eagerly, even if its
  response Observable is not subscribed to. Default: **false**.

#### Return:

*(Function)* the HTTP Driver function
